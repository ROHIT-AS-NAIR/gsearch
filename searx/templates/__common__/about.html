        <li>Gsearch is free software, the code is 100% open and you can help to make it better.
    <p>If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise believe

<h2>Technical details - How does it work?</h2>

<p>Gsearch is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine">metasearch engine</a>,
inspired by Googles search engine.<br /> It provides basic privacy by mixing your queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data. Queries are made using a POST request on every browser (except chrome*). Therefore they show up in neither our logs, nor your url history. In case of Chrome* users there is an exception, Gsearch uses the search bar to perform GET requests.<br />
Gsearch can be added to your browser's search bar; moreover, it can be set as the default search engine.
